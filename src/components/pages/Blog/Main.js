                In fact, a number of our own hero hounds were awarded PDSA medals for their noses! Arms and explosives search dog Buster (pictured above) was awarded his PDSA Dickin Medal in 2003 for his remarkable service in Iraq â€“ he located a large amount of weapons and explosives linked to an extremist group, saving the lives of many civilians and service personnel.

                Cats are really good jumpers and can jump really high.
                You can often see them on the top of a garden fence or on a really high wall!
